## Technologies

Let's try to use the latest version of the packages and TypeScript as the main language. 
Vite is used for bundling and package.json tasks for running / building the app.

TypeScript code should be without any suppressions of errors and without compiling errors.

## Structure

The project should a monorepo, with packages/ which are defined by the scope of the functionality:

- Frontend 
- Server (main)
- Server (remote acp)

## README.md

installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information.
