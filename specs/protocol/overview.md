- **Clients**: Applications (like IntelliJ IDEA) that interact with agents
- **Sessions**: Interactive contexts where agents execute tasks

### Supported Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ACP      | Agent Client Protocol for AI agent communication |
| MCP      | Model Context Protocol for tool integration |
